Project Euler in Ruby

Solutions to Project Euler problems in Ruby.

These solutions will probably be relatively ugly at first, but as I progress I will incorporate what I learn from the following resources:

1. Ruby Style Guide (https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)
2. Eloquent Ruby
3. Zenspider's Quick Reference (http://www.zenspider.com/Languages/Ruby/QuickRef.html)
4. Ruby from other languages (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/)
