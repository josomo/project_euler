#A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum #of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.

#A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum #exceeds n.

#As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two #abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as #the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is #known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.

#Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
